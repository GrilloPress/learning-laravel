# Creating a Laravel App

1. create a template

In Laravel, unlike other frameworks like Rails (if you are aware of them), they create a strong structure for your "views". 

That is, in Rails, when you generate a controller it creates a whole load of templates in a views folder (and subfolders). With Laravel, this is left up to you.
