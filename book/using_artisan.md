# Using Artisan

The Artisan CLI is a Laravel command-line tool that provides a range of helpful commands such as creating databases and tables.

To run an Artisan command you write ```php artisan``` followed by the command you require.

If you want to see the whole range of commands, each worth googling to find out what they do in-depth, you can run:

```
php artisan list
```

If you need some spot help, artisan also has a help command. So, to find out more about the migration functionality of ```artisan``` you'd run:

```
php artisan help migrate
```
