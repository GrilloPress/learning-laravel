# Building an App with Laravel

In this chapter we will go through the processes required to build an app that enables a business unit to collect feedback.

Essentially, we will create a form service whereby we can embed via an iframe our form on any manner of static websites all over the internet.

The form will be simple but show how we could create a dashboard application that centralizes all of the places we collect feedback, input and customer viewpoints for our Product Managers/Community Managers to act on.

This tutorial is aimed at teaching:

1. Create an admin dashboard (and all the authentication that comes with that)
2. Creating forms (for external use)
3. Allowing Cross-header applications so our page can be used elsewhere
4. Saving feedback to a database as well as emailing it to our admins
5. Allowing comments/notes and extra information to be added to feedback forms
